# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-29

### Removed
- **MoviesMod provider**: Permanently removed — `moviesmod.farm` returns HTTP 403 with Cloudflare managed challenge (`cf-mitigated: challenge`). No server-side workaround exists without a browser runtime.
- **VidZee provider**: Permanently removed — hardcoded AES-256-GCM salt is no longer valid against VidZee's current API key blob, causing all decryption to fail.

### Fixed
- **LordFlix provider**: Updated upstream domain (`network.hasta-la-vista.site` → `snowhouse.lordflix.club`) and refreshed server list (10 servers).
- **Docker startup crash**: Added missing `COPY proxy ./proxy` to both build and runtime stages in `Dockerfile` — `apiServer.js` unconditionally requires `./proxy/proxyServer` at startup.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-16

## Dependency Security
- **npm vulnerabilities fixed**: Upgraded `cheerio` (1.0.0 → 1.2.0) and `axios-cookiejar-support` (6.0.2 → 7.0.0) to eliminate 14 vulnerabilities (including `undici <=6.23.0` high/critical CVEs). Result: 0 vulnerabilities.

### Added
- **Videasy provider**: 10-server parallel scraper via enc-dec.app decrypt relay.
- **Vidlink provider**: Single-stream HLS source via enc-dec.app encode relay.
- **LordFlix provider**: 9-server scraper via enc-dec.app (replaces defunct Vidsync).
- **NoTorrent provider**: Stremio addon API bridge (`addon-osvh.onrender.com`).
- **DahmerMovies provider**: Open-directory direct file link scraper with proxy rewrite.
- **GitHub Sponsors button**: Official iframe embed in admin sidebar and README badge.

### Removed
- **Vidsync provider**: All 6 servers returned HTTP 401 — API locked. Replaced by LordFlix.
- **MP4Hydra provider**: Dead upstream, removed entirely.
- **UHDMovies provider**: Dead upstream, removed entirely.
- **vidsrcextractor.js**: Unused legacy file removed.

### Fixed
- **Provider enable/disable not working at runtime**: Removed the startup-time enabled/disabled filter. All providers are now always loaded into the registry array. `listProviders()` and `getProvider()` now call `isProviderEnabled(name)` which reads the live `config` object on every call. Changes take effect immediately without a server restart.
- **Showbox/FebBox provider**: Restored with correct `responseType:'text'`, AJAX headers, and double `ui=` cookie bug fix.
- **MoviesMod provider**: Updated class-based selectors and added support for `links.modpro.blog`, `cloud.unblockedgames.world`, `tech.examdegree.site`, and `driveleech.net` domains.
- **VixSrc provider**: Corrected to proper 2-step API flow.

---

## [1.0.9] - 2025-11-19

### Removed
- **Showbox/FebBox/PStream provider**: Permanently removed due to PStream API being protected by Cloudflare bot detection, making it inaccessible without complex proxy infrastructure
  - Deleted `providers/Showbox.js` and backup files
  - Removed FebBox cookie management from configuration panel
  - Removed `FEBBOX_COOKIES`, `SHOWBOX_CACHE_DIR`, and related environment variables
  - Cleaned up all Showbox-specific logic from provider registry
  - Removed FebBox/PStream configuration UI panel and related functions
- **Unused dependencies**: Removed 121 packages including puppeteer, patchright, puppeteer-extra, puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth, and vm2 (~200MB+ saved)
- **Unused utility files**: Removed `cloudflareBypasser.js` and `jsunpack.js`

### Fixed
- **VidZee provider**: Updated to support two-stage AES decryption with dynamic API keys. The provider now fetches an encrypted key from `https://core.vidzee.wtf/api-key`, decrypts it using AES-256-GCM with a hardcoded key, then uses the result to decrypt video URLs with AES-256-CBC. Includes 1-hour API key caching for performance.
- **4khdhub provider**: Added support for `links.modpro.blog` domain (site migrated from `modrefer.in`).
- **moviesmod provider**: Added support for `links.modpro.blog` domain alongside existing `modrefer.in`.
- **uhdmovies provider**: Fixed domain to use `uhdmovies.rip` instead of outdated `uhdmovies.mov`. Added automatic domain replacement for stale scraped URLs. Created new `utils/linkResolver.js` utility to handle driveseed/driveleech download button extraction (supports Instant Download, Resume Cloud, Resume Worker Bot, Direct Links CF Type 1).
- **Provider registry**: Fixed `listProviders()` to return all available providers with their enabled status, not just enabled ones. Config panel now shows all 6 providers correctly.

## [1.0.8] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- Added `processStreamsForProxy` so the aggregate and provider-specific endpoints automatically rewrite stream URLs through the internal `/m3u8-proxy`/`/ts-proxy` layer whenever `enableProxy` is turned on, stripping provider headers safely.

### Changed
- Showbox provider overhaul: filesystem-only caching (Redis removed), smarter FebBox cookie selection with region fallbacks, TMDB title/image validation that recognises romanized names, plus cached HEAD size lookups for faster listings.
- Vixsrc provider rewritten to parse the `window.masterPlaylist` payload (token + expiry), returning a single master playlist with English subtitle lookup and correct Referer headers.
- Config loader now prefers `utils/user-config.json`, dedupes TMDB keys, defaults provider enable flags to `true`, and scrubs legacy proxy env values when mirroring overrides back to `process.env`.
- 4KHDHub provider permanently drops `.zip` archive links instead of trimming extensions and improves host distribution logging.
- Provider registry dynamically enumerates available modules (removing MoviesClub/Xprime remnants) while keeping per-request cookie stats for the admin debug panel.

### Removed
- Deleted legacy `providers/moviesclub.js`, `providers/xprime.js`, and other unused proxy/auth remnants that were no longer referenced.

### Fixed
- Aggregated responses now obey the proxy flag without client changes—streams returned from `/api/streams/...` are proxy-wrapped and omit upstream header hints when `enableProxy` is active.

## [1.0.7] - 2025-09-21

### Added
- VidZee provider: definitive AES-256-CBC decoder (replaced heuristic token attempts). Decodes newly obfuscated `atob(token) => ivBase64:cipherBase64` structure using padded key `qrincywincyspider` and PKCS7.
- Tail segment acceleration: internal tail prefetch map (`tailPrefetchMap`) with TTL cleanup and configurable `tailPrefetchKB` (default 256 KB) now documented and instrumented.

### Changed
- Proxy range negotiation: clarified interaction between `progressiveOpen` and synthetic initial partial (auto-suppression when progressive active). Additional debug logging around tail cache hits and forced host overrides.
- VidZee streams now always return direct decrypted URLs (per-stream `originalToken` retained for debugging when `VIDZEE_DEBUG=1`).
- Updated README version badge to 1.0.7.

### Fixed
- Eliminated edge cases where encoded VidZee tokens were leaking through without decoding.
- Reduced VLC initial loop behavior via tail prefetch serving last-byte probes from cache faster (combined with earlier 1.0.6 range logic).

### Documentation
- README: implicit improvements carried forward (no separate section required) plus badge bump.
- CHANGELOG: recorded AES decoder details & tail prefetch instrumentation.

### Notes
- Future proxy tuning items (size meta map, dynamic progressive growth) tracked but not part of this release.


## [1.0.6] - 2025-09-20

### Removed
- MoviesClub provider (multi-server scraping complexities & Turnstile challenge; deprecated permanently)
- Xprime provider (upstream Xprime.tv offline due to security changes)
 - 4khdhub provider: all `.zip` archive links are now omitted entirely (previous releases experimented with stripping the extension which produced non‑playable pseudo‑MKV links)

### Added
- Structured multi-server debug instrumentation (session summaries, per-fetch metrics, pattern counters)
- Turnstile challenge detection & bypass attempt scaffold (synthetic `/rcp_verify` token posting)
- Optional internal stream proxy (`enableProxy` flag): mounts `/m3u8-proxy`, `/ts-proxy`, `/sub-proxy` with playlist + segment + subtitle handling and segment prefetch cache.
 - Proxy range management features:
   - `clampOpen` (default on) – caps ambiguous open‑ended `bytes=0-` requests to a bounded initial window (`openChunkKB`, default 4096 KB)
   - `progressiveOpen` (default on) – incremental expansion of the head range on successive `bytes=0-` requests instead of a single huge span
   - `initChunkKB` (default 512 KB) – size of the synthetic initial 206 response when neither clamp/progressive produce a range and `noSynth` is not set
   - `tailPrefetch` (default on) + `tailPrefetchKB` (default 256 KB) – asynchronous fetch & in‑memory cache of the file tail to satisfy rapid VLC tail probes
   - `force200` (opt‑in) – normalizes upstream 206 responses to 200 for diagnostics
   - `noSynth` (opt‑in) – disables synthetic initial partial response generation
 - Tail prefetch TTL cleanup task (30 min window) and in‑memory maps for: segment cache, open range clamp, progressive growth, and tail buffers
 - Host routing overrides: `pixeldrain.*` & `video-downloads.googleusercontent.com` are forced through `/ts-proxy` (extensionless or ambiguous content)

### Changed
- Centralized multi-server request headers with realistic `sec-ch-ua*` & `Sec-Fetch-*` values
- Added retry, rotating User-Agent, and cookie jar logic to multi-server fetch pipeline
- Showbox provider priority map updated after Xprime removal
- README/Docs trimmed to reflect current active providers only
- When `enableProxy` is active, stream response objects have their original `headers` field removed (proxy handles all required headers internally).
 - 4khdhub provider now filters out archive endpoints instead of attempting extension normalization (prevents feeding ZIP files to players)
 - Open‑ended range handling improved to reduce VLC negotiation loops by throttling first‑pass read size and growing progressively
 - Synthetic initial partial response is automatically suppressed when `progressiveOpen` is active (real range growth preferred)

### Fixed
- Ensured multi-server fallback attempts (direct rcp player/m3u8 extraction) operate with improved diagnostics
 - Eliminated repeated VLC tail probe stalls caused by archive masquerading as video content (root cause was filtered by dropping `.zip` URLs)

### Documentation
 - Updated README version badge to 1.0.6 and provider list (removed MoviesClub & Xprime, clarified active providers list)
 - Added proxy tuning parameter reference (clamp/progressive/tail prefetch, synthetic partial, force200) and host override notes
 - Expanded explanation that per‑stream headers are stripped when proxying is enabled


## [1.0.5] - 2025-09-19

### Improved
- 4khdhub provider: Permanently block `r2.dev` FSL links (previous optional flag removed).
- Added Referer/Origin headers automatically for FSL Server links during validation (prior to block enforcement ensured proper behavior).
- Tightened URL validation: removed unconditional trust for `r2.dev`; validation logic now consistent across hosts.
- Host distribution instrumentation logs final hostname counts for easier diagnostics.
- Preserved HubCloud worker `.zip` links by stripping the `.zip` extension instead of discarding them (enables direct playback attempts).

### Notes
- `r2.dev` links are always removed from final output; no env flag required.

### Documentation

## [1.0.4] - 2025-09-18

### Added

### Changed
  ```json
  { "title": "…", "url": "…", "quality": "…", "provider": "…", "headers": { } }
  ```

## [1.0.3] - 2025-09-17

### Fixed
- Server now binds to `0.0.0.0` by default so Docker port publishing works correctly from the host. Added `BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` in Dockerfile and compose.

### Notes
- If you were seeing `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` on `http://localhost:8787`, pull the latest image or rebuild, then re-run with `-p 8787:8787`.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-09-17

### Fixed
- Standardized Docker port to `8787` everywhere (Dockerfile `EXPOSE`, compose `ports`, healthchecks, and README examples). Previous release notes mentioned 8787 but some environments weren't reset; this release ensures consistency.

### Documentation
- Updated README version badge to 1.0.2 and verified Docker commands use `-p 8787:8787`.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-17

### Added
- Admin UI: Restart Server button (below Logout) with a themed confirmation modal. The UI polls `/api/health` and auto-reloads when the server is back.
- Sidebar divider under Logout/Restart for clarity.

### Changed
- Exclude Codecs presets:
  - Introduced "None" (default) → `{ "excludeDV": false, "excludeHDR": false }`.
  - "All" → `{ "excludeDV": true, "excludeHDR": true }`.
  - Persist and render presets reliably after Save / Reload.
- Minimum Quality: Clear All now resets to `"all"` and selects the All preset in the UI.
- Clear All: Now fully resets TMDB keys, FebBox cookies, providers, and filters; added a themed confirmation modal with optional "Don't ask again" preference.
- Live Config: Hide legacy `tmdbApiKey` (only show `tmdbApiKeys`).
- Restart behavior:
  - Local dev: Nodemon watches `restart.trigger`; backend writes it before a clean exit to force a restart.
  - Docker: Compose uses `restart: unless-stopped`; Docker restarts the container after restart endpoint triggers exit.
- Dockerfile: Ensure non-root `app` user owns `/app` for writing overrides and restart marker.
- package.json scripts: Simplified to `start`, `start:dev`, and `lint`; both start scripts are nodemon-based and watch `restart.trigger`.

### Fixed
- Provider matrix re-renders immediately after Clear All (no page refresh needed).
- Handling of Exclude Codecs "ALL" previously not persisting correctly.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-16

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-16

### Added
- Comprehensive `README.md` (features, endpoints, admin UI overview, screenshots gallery, Docker usage, troubleshooting).
- `LICENSE` (MIT) file.
- Multi‑TMDB key rotation support (array of keys; random selection per request).
- Config override system writing to `utils/user-config.json` with live merged view.
- Session-based authentication (login, logout, session check, password change) with brute-force mitigation.
- Rate limiting + exponential lockouts for failed login attempts.
- Provider status & metrics endpoints: `/api/health`, `/api/metrics`, `/api/status`, `/api/providers`.
- Stream aggregation endpoints (aggregate + provider-specific) with filtering pipeline.
- Diagnostics instrumentation (intercept `process.exit`, `beforeExit`, unhandled rejection / exception logging, periodic heartbeat interval).
- Docker assets: multi-stage `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.yml` with persistent volume for overrides.
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`) for automatic multi-arch (amd64+arm64) build & push on branch and tag (`v*`).
- OCI metadata labels and build argument (`VERSION`) in Docker image.
- Version + (placeholder) Docker pulls badges in README header.
- VidSrc extractor refactor: removed direct `process.exit` calls; `main()` now returns status code (safer when required as a module).

### Changed
- Config normalization now clears legacy single `tmdbApiKey` when `tmdbApiKeys` override is explicitly emptied.
- Dockerfile slimmed: narrowed COPY set, added labels, build arg, retained only necessary runtime artifacts.
- `.dockerignore` expanded to reduce build context (`.git`, logs, markdown except README, tests, CI configs, caches, compose file, etc.).

### Removed
- Deprecated `uhdmovies` provider: code file, registry references, UI toggles, documentation mentions.

### Security
- Hardened auth flow: session cookies (HttpOnly), no-store headers for admin pages, escalating lockouts against brute force.

### CI / Automation
- Added multi-arch Docker publish workflow using Buildx & QEMU.

### Documentation
- Added Docker usage section (local build, compose, multi-key usage, env vars table, healthcheck notes).
- Added screenshots gallery of admin UI.
- Updated docs to reflect provider removal and new configuration semantics.
- Added this `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Developer Experience
- Heartbeat diagnostic interval to aid investigation of unexpected exits.
- Intercepted premature `process.exit` calls to avoid silent shutdowns during debugging.

## Historical Context
This 1.0.0 release consolidates modernization work: provider cleanup, configuration clarity, deployment ergonomics (Docker + CI), security hardening, and observability.
